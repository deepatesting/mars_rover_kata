# Mars Rover Tech Task
Test Driven Development exercise for Mars Rover.

### What is a kata?

A Kata in martial arts means ‚Äúa system of individual training exercises‚Äù. Just like in martial arts, coding also requires consistent practise to hone in the skill.

### Your Task

You're part of the team that explores Mars by sending remotely controlled vehicles(Rovers) to the surface of the planet. Develop an API that translates the commands sent from earth to instructions that are understood by the rover.

### Instructions

Read more [here](/docs/MarsRoverMissionInstructions.pdf) about the instructions to achieve this task.

**Considerations:**

- You can make the assumption that the Plateau is rectangular, but be sure to have a think about how easily your program can be extended upon in the future to support a different shaped Plateau.
- How might your Plateau support other vehicles and not just Rovers?
- Have fun with it! It‚Äôs not every day you get to put a Rover on Mars, get creative and enjoy! üëΩ

### Hints

* Start with a failing test. This is a good Kata to practice TDD.
* Make your tests small in the beginning. Start with an empty String, then with Strings containing only one character. After all cases have been fulfilled, start with multiple commands in the string.

### UnitTests

cd to the project root folder in the command line

Run ``mvn test``
